## Docker-Pipework
**_A docker image of jpetazzo's pipework_**

Recommended with the `crane` orchestration tool. [See here for an example](3. Examples.md#crane).

This docker image encapsulates the awesome [jpetazzo/pipework](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework) networking configuration script. You can now run pipework as a docker container. The configurable [run modes](2. Usage.md#run-modes) determine how the pipework command is invoked on your docker containers.

Specifying an environment variable named [`pipework_cmd`](4. Config.md#pipework_cmd) on your container will tell the `dreamcat4/pipework` image to run jpetazzo's `pipework` script. And with those specific pipework flags.

There are many reasons to use the pipework tool. It may be to give your container an external IP address, or a macvlan L2 ethernet bridge, a particular [MAC address](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework/blob/master/README.md#custom_mac), a dynamic or a static [DHCP lease](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework/blob/master/README.md#dhcp). To be able to [manually configure the IP address](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework/blob/master/README.md#no_ip) from inside the container. To set up [host routes](4. Config.md#host_routes) so that those IPs are reachable / visible on the docker host. Or to [create a private bridge](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework/blob/master/README.md#lamp) between N other containers].

Or perhaps you want to do all of those things! For multiple pipework commands on 1 container use the simple [`.*pipework_cmd.*` regexp matching](4. Config.md#globbing). e.g. `pipework_cmd1=`, `pipework_cmd2=` etc.

Requires privileged mode, access to the host PID namespace, and the host's networking stack. ~ But only on the `dreamcat4/pipework` container, not on any of your application containers.

### Support

Should you experience any problems with this image, there are a couple of things to try.

* Please first check that the same pipework command will run correctly on the command line on your host system. By installing pipework script on your host system as a standalone tool.

* Pipework has it's own requirements. Which can be found in the official pipework documentation at [jpetazzo/pipework](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework/blob/master/README.md). For example `dhclient` is needed for the DHCP feature and so on.

* If the issue isn't with pipework, it may be todo with my docker image, which is what surrounds and encapsulates the `pipework` script. Then please open a [new issue](https://github.com/dreamcat4/docker-images/issues/new) here on my github repository.
